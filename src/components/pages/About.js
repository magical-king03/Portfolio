                <p>Hey, I'm Viswiesh.</p>
                <p>I'm currently studying B.Tech CSBS at Sastra University, Tanjore. I love to explore many ideas from my friends and professors.</p>

                <p>I'm passionate about many creative pursuits, including music, photography, and of course, coding. This combination of interests is what ultimately led me to crete projects on my own.</p>
                <p>I love building for the web. From something as simple as a single HTML file – all the way to large web applications. The web is incredible. Anyone can become a developer, writer, or creator – and no one has to ask for permission. You can just build.</p>
                <p>Besides web development, I'm currently doing an internship with the help of my professors on the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</p>
